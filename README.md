## Project introduction

As we move through the years as technology continues to advance, so must we. Recognizing this, our team has chosen to concentrate on a crucial aspect of our everyday lives that we all encounter on a weekly or monthly basis: car maintenance. Our aim is to simplify the process of maintaining vehicles for everyone, regardless of when or where it is required. To accomplish this, we have developed an application that offers an array of valuable features for car upkeep. Firstly, the app enables users to request services for minor car repairs, such as oil changes, battery replacements, and vehicle checkups, at any time. Upon utilizing this feature, one of our skilled technicians will be dispatched at the scheduled time. Secondly, if the vehicle requires more extensive maintenance, the user will be presented with a list of reliable car workshops in their area, with the option to book an appointment directly or have one of our team members collect their vehicle at a prearranged time. In summary, our objective is to create an application that assists people in making car maintenance more accessible and manageable..

## Problem Statement 

In today's world, we are witnessing a shift from conventional methods to more technologically advanced approaches in various aspects of life
One issue with the current car maintenance sector is the considerable amount of time it takes to deal with vehicle repairs. Whenever your
car requires fixing, you must search for an appropriate workshop, wait in line for your turn, and often endure significant traffic on the way.


## Devolpment Tools
### Draw.io
is an technology stack for building diagramming applications, and the world's most widely used browser-based end-user diagramming software. 
### Figma
It is a popular tool for designers, product managers, writers and developers and helps anyone involved in the design process contribute, give feedback, and make better decisions, faster.
### Flutter(Programming)
an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications from a single codebase for any web browser, Fuchsia, Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows.
### Visual Studio Code (Code editor)
 is a powerful developer tool that you can use to complete the entire development cycle in one place. It is a comprehensive integrated development environment (IDE) that you can use to write, edit, debug, and build code, and then deploy your app.
### Android studio (emulator)
 is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android application development.
 It is based on IntelliJ IDEA, a Java integrated development environment for software, and incorporates its code editing and developer tools.
 ### BlueStack X (emulator)
 empowers gamers to discover the best gameplay experience on the cloud or PC. Gamers can download and play a mobile game on a PC or get started instantly in the browser without any downloads, installs.
 ### PHP for the API 
  variables that your application will need to call in order to carry out its desired task. In the case of PHP applications that need to communicate with databases the necessary APIs are usually exposed via PHP extensions.
  ### Firebase
  Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets organizations store and sync data in real time across all of their users' devices. This makes it easy to build apps that are always up to date, even when users are offline.
  ## Implemntion
System implementation involves the process of determining the construction of an information system, ensuring its functionality and usage, and meeting quality standards. In this section, we will demonstrate the steps taken for system implementation, including the acquisition of necessary hardware and software resources. Additionally, we will present our test plan and outcomes to verify the key functionalities of our product, enabling us to launch it successfully. We will also provide the source code for the entire application, detailing any modifications made from the initial version to the final version. A user guide for the proposed system will be included as well. Lastly, we will explain the system installation process, allowing you to explore the system independently.
